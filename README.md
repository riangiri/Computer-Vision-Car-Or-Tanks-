## Problem Statement
**based on a report from the ICRC [Click Here] (https://www.interaction.org/blog/when-war-moves-to-cities-protection-of-civilians-in-urban-areas-3/)     
In recent years, there has been an increase in urban warfare or violent conflicts involving civilians who are not armed. Based on this issue, military equipment technology plays a significant role in enhancing object detection, particularly in order to reduced the possibility casualties from false detect object in the urban area.**

## Objective 
**Create computer vision modeling to classify image of Tanks or Cars objects with f1-score metrics**

## Technical Conclusion    
**Model Accuracy Without Improvement = 80**    
**1a. Model Precision with Enhanced = 86**    

**F1-score average (f1-score) for car object detection without improvement = 81**         
**2a. F1-score for car model improvement detection = 88**        

**Tank detection for Non Improvement model average (f1-score) = 79**         
**2a. the F1-score for the Tanks Model Improvement detection = 86**    

**The model is nearly goodfit for loss vs. val-loss and accuracy thanks to the use of the Dropout layer and data augmentation.**
